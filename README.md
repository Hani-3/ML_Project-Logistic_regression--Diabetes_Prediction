# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. The model is trained on the Diabetes dataset, which contains various physiological features such as glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI), among others.






## Features

- Utilizes logistic regression for binary classification (diabetic/non-diabetic).
- Implements a Flask API for easy integration into web applications.
- Provides endpoints for real-time predictions.


## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is the Diabetes dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. It consists of various features and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

## Deployment
